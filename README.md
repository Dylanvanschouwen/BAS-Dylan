Open-source BAS project made by Dylan van Schouwen (and honestly? a slight use of AI but who doesn't do that nowadays)
No yoinking my code without not giving credit though (no stealing <3)

- Pull this repository to your own or download the zip file.
- In MySQL ONLY import the database bas_boodschappenservice.
- Start up the site on localhost and click on src to open the website
- Have fun
